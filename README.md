## Context:
This is our first group project of Mod 2 at Turing School of Software & Design. We were given three weeks to create this project from scratch using a provided comp found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-2/whats-cookin-part-one.html) and [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-2/whats-cookin-part-two-agile.html).

## Learning Goals:
- Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation.
- Create a user interface that is easy to use and clearly displays information.
- Write DRY, reusable code that follows SRP and trends toward function purity.
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD.
- Make network requests to retrieve data.
- Collaborate productively and professionally as a team. Ensure all team members are able to be heard and contribute throughout the project.
